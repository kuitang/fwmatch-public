This folder contains functions for data processing. The code will generate
.mat format data from raw datasets in csv format.

To run the data parsing code, simply go to the root directory, and run

make -f cook.mk

Description
-----------

combineTable.m 

This function takes all csv files that are provided as a list of full file 
paths, and then merge them into a single cell array.

variables and stores into a structure including VariableName, VariableLevels, 
and indices. 
For example, the csv file contains 10 columns, which named as var_level1, 
var_level2, ... var_level10, the function will return 

VariableName: var, Levels: 10, indices: 1:10

retrieveCSV.m

This function will loop through all the subfolders to search for csv files

runDataParsing.m

This script will take all the csv files and call the corresponding functions
to generate desired .mat data

strescape.m / strsplit.m
