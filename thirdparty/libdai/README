1. Download libDAI here https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/j.m.mooij/libDAI/ and follow
   its directions to compile. You should compile with MATLAB enabled.

2. After a successful compile, you should see a directory called matlab/. Copy
   its contents to the matlab/ directory in this folder. Alternatively, replace
   this whole directory with a symlink.
